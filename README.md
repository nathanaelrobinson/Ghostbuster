Not spending much time on usability but if you want test it you can import the entire file and run ghostbusters(iterations) with the number of iterations you'd like. The script returns an array of the moving averages for each iteration which are also saved as x, and y so that you can easily plot them. 

Over 5000 iterations or so it seems to converge at 49.5%
